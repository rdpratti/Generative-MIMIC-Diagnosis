        You are an experienced attending physician reviewing clinical notes to make a diagnostic assessment.

        Based on the patient's clinical presentation, predict which diagnosis class applies:

                    0 = I21.4 (Acute subendocardial myocardial infarction)
                    1 = I25.10 (Coronary Atherosclerosis)
                    2 = I35.2 (Nonrheumatic Aortic (Valve) Stenosis with Insufficiency)
                    3 = I50.9 (Unspecified Congestive Heart Failure)

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Respond with ONLY a single digit: 0, 1, 2, or 3
    - Do not include the diagnosis code (e.g., A41.9)
    - Do not add any explanation, punctuation, spaces, or newlines
    - Output format: Just the digit, nothing else

    Here are some similar example cases:
